#Autonomous Drone Obstacle Avoidance
Overview
This project focuses on developing an autonomous drone capable of navigating complex terrains by dynamically adjusting its altitude to avoid obstacles and adapt to varying ground elevations. Utilizing real-time sensor data, the drone intelligently modifies its flight path to ensure safe and efficient traversal of environments with uneven terrain.​

Features
Terrain-Adaptive Flight: The drone continuously assesses the terrain below and adjusts its height to maintain a safe distance from the ground, ensuring smooth navigation over hills, valleys, and other undulating landscapes.​

Obstacle Detection and Avoidance: Equipped with advanced sensors, the drone detects obstacles in its flight path and autonomously alters its trajectory to prevent collisions.​

Real-Time Sensor Integration: The system integrates data from various sensors to make immediate flight adjustments, enhancing responsiveness to sudden changes in the environment.​

Repository Structure
sensors/: Contains modules responsible for interfacing with and processing data from the drone's sensors.​

config/: Holds configuration files that define parameters for flight control, sensor thresholds, and other adjustable settings.​

docs/: Includes documentation related to the project, such as system architecture diagrams and user manuals.​

main.py: The primary script that initializes the drone's systems and manages the flight control loop.​

requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies necessary to run the project.​

system_architecture.png: A visual representation of the system's architecture, illustrating the interaction between components.​
